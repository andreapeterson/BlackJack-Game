# BlackJack-Game

Welcome to Python BlackJack! This is just another fun little game where I combined multiple things in Python such as def() functions, while and for loops, and if/elif/else statements.

Disclaimer: It is assumed in this game that there is an infinite deck. Moreover, once a card is pulled, it has the same probability of being drawn again.
