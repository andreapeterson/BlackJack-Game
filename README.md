# BlackJack-Game

Welcome to Python BlackJack! In this game, you will play blackjack against the computer. It combines multiple things in Python such as def() functions, while and for loops, and if/elif/else statements. The computer will always draw a card if it has a score less than 17.

Disclaimer: It is assumed in this game that there is an infinite deck. Moreover, once a card is pulled, it has the same probability of being drawn again.
